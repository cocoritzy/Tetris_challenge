# Summary of the development 
Step 1: Greedy algorithm that finds the best local solution (matching four empty blocks) 
Step 2: Improved greedy algorithm with a neighbouring system : the chosen best shape is the one with the fewest neighbours, meaning it is the most isolated.
Step 4: Implementation of an optimisation loop which place an extra three blocks in locations where there are ‘1s’ and one excess block where there is a ‘0’.
Step 5: optimising time by using the most optimised order of shape_ID.
